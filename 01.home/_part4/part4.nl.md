        body: 'When we started, members of our team acquired extensive experience in financial markets, including foreign exchange, commodity trading and gold investment. We programmed on automated trading platforms, tested early electronic assets systems and developed a multi-asset trading infrastructure. Exposure to real and crisis market conditions in this crucial period contributed to our belief that a new approach to personal finance is necessary in order to put economic growth back into the hands of you and me.'

        subheading: 'The Inception of Internet of Coins'
        body: 'Following the collapse of major centralised exchanges, the necessity for a fully decentralized exchange system became clear. We did not start with a fundraiser, since we wanted to ensure a ripened technological infrastructure in order to deliver on our promises. Instead, we authored our whitepaper and launched the <a href="http://internetofcoins.org/" target="_blank">internetofcoins.org</a> website. <a href="https://bitalo.com/" target="_blank">Bitalo</a> supported us with a seed donation in this initial period.'

        body: 'As the project grew in scale, we set up an office to work with the team. Our first operational prototype will be tested by an alpha-user community in the Netherlands to ensure security and usability. They provided us with essential feedback as to the usability and user experience of our personal finance environment, and continue to do so. Matthias Klees from The Federated Blockchains Initiative joined our cause and the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/" target="_blank">NLnet Foundation</a> became our funding and legal advisors.'
