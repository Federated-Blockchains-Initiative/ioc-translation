## How
### Modularized interconnectivity of blockchains and value systems

<span class="column-left">
We have developed an interconnectivity platform with a node-to-node system called <a href="https://github.com/internetofcoins/hybridd" target="_blank"><i>hybridd</i></a>. It forms a web, featuring the ability to connect value systems and synchronize ingoing and outgoing data flows by way of a scalable data chain; an innovation that we call the <i>weavechain</i>. <br><br><b>The entire system is modularized.</b><br><br> From its scheduling and routing engine, the interfaces and adaptors towards various cryptocurrencies, up to its modern peer-to-peer encrypted communications system.

Our ultimate goal is to let every cryptocurrency autonomously become part of a massive swarm of decentralized global financial interaction. We aim to do this by enabling any actor in the network to establish value tokens, known as hybrid assets, that interconnect value systems and blockchains across markets. <br><br><b>We strive to allow every cryptocurrency to autonomously interconnect in a large swarm of decentralized economic activity, by using a weavechain.</b><br><br> The programming code to make this possible will be open source, available on a not-for-profit basis and freely accessible to all, in order to enable the impartial establishment of what we call the <a href="https://internetofcoins.org" target="_blank">Internet of Coins</a>.</span>

<a href="https://internetofcoins.org" target="_blank">Internet of Coins</a> has the ability to communicate securely through time-honoured and well-tested standard internet protocols, as well as being able to employ deep web layered networks like <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">TOR</a>, <a href="https://geti2p.net/" target="_blank">I2P</a> or <a href="https://zeronet.io/" target="_blank">ZeroNet</a> when communicating between peers. Hybrid asset constructors afford liquidity and compatibility with a scala of different blockchain and ledger systems.</span><span class="column-right small" style="height: 9em;">![Deployment](deployment.svg "We aim to secure the network beyond current standards and ideas.")</span>

<b>No changes need to be made to any part of a cryptocurrency or value system to allow it to participate.</b><br><br>Every non-proprietary blockchain or value system can be hooked into this evolving network. A unique allocation schema ensures that currencies with a small <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank">marketcap</a> receive the needed liquidity to support their exchange and relevancy within a healthy cryptosphere. In this way, we seek to support and expand markets towards maintaining a diverse and plural crypto-ecosystem.
