# ioc-translation

Every page of our site is in a folder, and inside this folder are the folders for the different parts of that page.

Add a translation file by copying whatever.en.md to whatever.XY.md 

(Where XY is the language code of your translated country/language, e.g. ru for Russion, cn for Chinese, etc.)

When a translator shows up for the job, create an issue that refers to the language or file that has to be translated and assign this issue to a translator explicitly in the issue. This will be our official assignment of a translation to a certain translator. 

Example issue text: Translate English to Russian (all .ru.md files) appointed to @Russki

(They need to create their own free github account and give you their github nickname, so you can allow them into the translation repo.)
